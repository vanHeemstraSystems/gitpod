# GitPod

Based on "GitPod" at https://gitpod.io/

This repository is intended to demonstrate the use of the Cloud Development Environment called "GitPod".

By going to https://gitpod.io and choose (or create) a Workspace, you will then be given the option to connect to a GitHub repository like this one.

Once opened in GitPod, you can develop the code of that repository at your hearts content : )

Happy coding in the Cloud!
