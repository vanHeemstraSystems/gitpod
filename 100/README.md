# 100 - Introduction

This repository is intended to demonstrate the use of the Cloud Development Environment called "GitPod".

1. First go to https://gitpod.io and sign-up / login with your GitHub account
2. Next create a new **Project** in gitpod.io and choose an Organization (here: vanHeemstraSystems) and choose a dedicated repository within that organization (here: vanHeemstraSystems/gitpod).
3. Third, create a Workspace; you will be given the option to connect to a GitHub repository (here: vanHeemstraSystems/gitpod).
4. Lastly, choose your editor (e.g., Visual Studio Cocde in the browser) and the size of your development environment (in CPUs).

Once opened in GitPod, you can develop the code of that repository at your hearts content : )

P.S. When opened, a Welcome page will allow you to learn all about GitPod.

Happy coding in the Cloud!
